ASSIGNMENT 1
1. Write a function called 'describeCountry' which takes three parameters:
'country', 'population' and 'capitalCity'. Based on this input, the
function returns a string with this format: 'Finland has 6 million people and its
capital city is Helsinki'
2. Call this function 3 times, with input data for 3 different countries. Store the
returned values in 3 different variables, and log them to the console

/*
ASSIGNMENT 2
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
the world population
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
and then multiply by 100
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
store the results into variables, and log them to the console
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
the same populations)
